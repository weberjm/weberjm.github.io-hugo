> Bicycles, he says, provide an important balance between the pace of cars and of pedestrians. They slow down traffic, and invite foot traffic, and can even [drum up business and increase property values](http://www.ssti.us/Events/the-positive-link-between-bike-and-pedestrian-street-improvements-and-economic-activity-in-nyc/).

As a daily biker, I hope that I am not just being used for traffic calming!  However, the idea that bikes act as a buffer between pedestrians and automobiles is one I had not heard before.  Unfortunately, a car hitting a biker causes similar (or worse!) damage as one hitting a pedestrian.

It will take a long time for American drivers to truly learn how to share the road with bikes.  Here in Germany, people are much more aware, and still there are frequent accidents.

In all, though, the ability to travel anywhere in the city quickly and without the need for a car is a great benefit, and I would not want to give up my bike for a car right now!
